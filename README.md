# Curserat's Landing Page
Styled Website from scratch

My thoughts:

Finally done.

Building the overall layout was no problem, but making the website behave normally was.
I spent most of my time making sure the content filled the page correctly when resizing the window.

One issue that I could not figure out was how to make the content not spill out of the page wrapper.
I just decided to use overflow:hidden; as an easy fix.

Overall, I'm satisfied with the overall result.
